            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                In the context of the course "INFO-F420 - Computational Geometry" given at the ULB, we construct this 
                page to explore a topic in computational geometry by studying a scientific article and implementing 
                the algorithm described in it. The goal is to understand the concepts presented in the article and to 
                implement the algorithm in order to present it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our subject concerns the Attraction Region and the Inverse Attraction Region in a Simple Polygon. To 
                explore these topics, we will study the article "Attraction-Convexity and Normal Visibility" by P. 
                Bose and T. C. Shermer [1] and the article "An Optimal Algorithm to Compute the Inverse Beacon 
                Attraction Region" by I. Kostitsyna, B. Kouhestani, S. Langerman, and D. Rappaport [2].
            </p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project will explore the concept of attraction-convexity, a geometric property derived from
                beacon attraction. Beacon attraction describes a movement system in which a point moves to
                minimize its Euclidean distance to a beacon (another point). If there are no obstacles, the point
                moves directly toward the beacon; when obstacles are present, the point either slides along them or
                becomes stuck. A beacon is said to attract a point if the point can ultimately reach it by following
                this method.
            </p>
            <p>
                A polygon is considered attraction-convex if every point within it attracts every other point. These
                polygons, also referred to as normally visible polygons in the computational geometry literature, are
                discussed in the article “Attraction-Convexity and Normal Visibility” from the Computational
                Geometry journal [1], which forms the basis of our study. This article also presents a linear-time
                algorithm for recognizing attraction-convex polygons, which we will implement as part of this
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beacon attraction is not inherently symmetric, so we will also investigate inverse attraction regions.
                Like the second article said [2], these regions are more complex, as they are not always connected,
                making their computation more challenging compared to regular attraction regions.<br/><br/>
