            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                In the context of the course "INFO-F420 - Computational Geometry" given at the ULB, we construct this 
                page to explore a topic in computational geometry by studying a scientific article and implementing 
                the algorithm described in it. The goal is to understand the concepts presented in the article and to 
                implement the algorithm in order to present it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our subject concerns the Attraction Region and the Inverse Attraction Region in a Simple Polygon. To 
                explore these topics, we will study the article "Attraction-Convexity and Normal Visibility" by P. 
                Bose and T. C. Shermer [1] and the article "An Optimal Algorithm to Compute the Inverse Beacon 
                Attraction Region" by I. Kostitsyna, B. Kouhestani, S. Langerman, and D. Rappaport [2].
            </p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project will explore the concept of attraction-convexity, a geometric property derived from
                beacon attraction. Beacon attraction describes a movement system in which a point moves to
                minimize its Euclidean distance to a beacon (another point). If there are no obstacles, the point
                moves directly toward the beacon; when obstacles are present, the point either slides along them or
                becomes stuck. A beacon is said to attract a point if the point can ultimately reach it by following
                this method.
            </p>
            <p>
                A polygon is considered attraction-convex if every point within it attracts every other point. These
                polygons, also referred to as normally visible polygons in the computational geometry literature, are
                discussed in the article “Attraction-Convexity and Normal Visibility” from the Computational
                Geometry journal [1], which forms the basis of our study. This article also presents a linear-time
                algorithm for recognizing attraction-convex polygons, which we will implement as part of this
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beacon attraction is not inherently symmetric, so we will also investigate inverse attraction regions.
                Like the second article said [2], these regions are more complex, as they are not always connected,
                making their computation more challenging compared to regular attraction regions.<br/><br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Task Repartition</h2>

            <p>
                First of all, there were two main concepts to address, but we were three. Therefore, we prioritized the subject of Attraction Convexity and Normal Visibility above the Inverse Attraction Region. Loic and Kevin were in charge of this main topic, which required programming and summarizing. Quentin was in charge of the Inverse Attraction Region topic.
            </p>

            <p>
                Loic took charge of verifying the progress of his part with Kevin as support. This part was advancing at a good pace, and we succeeded in implementing the algorithm in a timely manner, allowing us to present it in the tool section. On the contrary, the Inverse Attraction Region led by Quentin was more challenging to understand, and as the focus wasn't on this topic, the implementation was laborious. We succeeded in implementing an algorithm that computes the Inverse Attraction Region, but it was not as efficient as we wanted. We followed the steps described in the article but skipped the particular data structure. However, Kevin gave a hand to interpret the complexity, which allowed us to distribute the workload and continue at a good pace.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nonetheless, with more collaboration, we succeeded in making this site, and we have ample materials to present our subject.
