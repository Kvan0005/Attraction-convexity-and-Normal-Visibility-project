            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This page was created in the context of the "INFO-F420 - Computational Geometry" course at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), and taught by Stefan Langerman. The goal of the project is to read and understand one or several recent research articles in computational geometry, related to the topic of choice. A creative work must be implemented demonstrating our deep understanding of the concepts described in the articles we read.</p>
            <p>Our group chose to study the "Reflections in an octagonal mirror maze" article by D. Eppstein.</p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project will explore the concept of attraction-convexity, a geometric property derived from
                beacon attraction. Beacon attraction describes a movement system in which a point moves to
                minimize its Euclidean distance to a beacon (another point). If there are no obstacles, the point
                moves directly toward the beacon; when obstacles are present, the point either slides along them or
                becomes stuck. A beacon is said to attract a point if the point can ultimately reach it by following
                this method.
            </p>
            <p>
                A polygon is considered attraction-convex if every point within it attracts every other point. These
                polygons, also referred to as normally visible polygons in the computational geometry literature, are
                discussed in the article “Attraction-Convexity and Normal Visibility” from the Computational
                Geometry journal [1], which forms the basis of our study. This article also presents a linear-time
                algorithm for recognizing attraction-convex polygons, which we will implement as part of this
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beacon attraction is not inherently symmetric, so we will also investigate inverse attraction regions.
                Like the second article said [2], these regions are more complex, as they are not always connected,
                making their computation more challenging compared to regular attraction regions.
