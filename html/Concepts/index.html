            <h1>Attraction-convexity and normal visibility</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Attraction-convex polygons are those where every point in the polygon attracts every other point.
                The attraction of a point <span>\(q\)</span> to a point <span>\(p\)</span> describes
                a movement system in which <span>\(q\)</span> moves to minimize at each instant
                its Euclidean distance with <span>\(p\)</span>.<br/>

                Normal-visible polygons are those where the normal to each point on the boundary of the polygon
                hits no point of the interior of the polygon.
                A conceptualisation of this second definition is to imagine an ant walking along
                the polygon counterclockwise, with a laser pointing to its right.
            </p>

            <div id="antAnimation"></div>

            <p>
                Observe the two movement of the ant : its rotation on the vertices with its normal sweeping Cones <span>\(C(v)\)</span> and
                its walking along the edges with its normal sweeping beams <span>\(B(e)\)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                An important part of the article was to prove that these two classes of polygons coincide,
                in order to construct an algorithm to verify if a polygon
                is Attraction-convex, based on Normally-visible polygons. Remind that we only study
                <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#simple-polygon">simple polygons</a> here.
            </p>

            <h2>Equivalence between the two classes</h2>
            Note that our proofs here are less formal but tend to be more simple than the original article.
            To prove equivalence between the two classes, we must consider the points <span>\(q'\)</span>, that are
            not attract to <span>\(p\)</span> (the <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#dead-point">dead points</a>).
            A dead point can appear in two cases :

            <div class="image-container">

                    <figcaption>(1) In a <span>\(pq'\)</span> perpendicular edge. </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../../images/deadpoint2.png" alt="convex vertex dead point"  style="width:100%;max-width:300px;">
                    <figcaption>(2) or in a <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#convex-vertex">Convex vertex</a> <br/>
                        when <span>\(pq'\)</span> is exterior to the polygon in the neighborhood of <span>\(q'\)</span>.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
            </div>

            <h3>Attraction-convex <span>\(\Rightarrow\)</span> normally visible</h3>
            <p>
                By absurd.<br/>
                Let's consider a point <span>\(q \in \)</span> edge <span>\(e\)</span> of <span>\(P\)</span> which is attraction-convex
                and not normally visible. the normal from <span>\(q\)</span> must touch another point <span>\(q'\)</span> in order to not be attraction-convex.
                But it means that <span>\(q'\)</span> is a type (1) dead point, then <span>\(P\)</span> was not attraction-convex, which is a contradiction.
            </p>

            <h3>Attraction-convex <span>\(\Leftarrow\)</span> normally visible</h3>
            <p>
                Let's prove the contrapositive, <span>\(\neg\)</span> Attraction-convex <span>\(\Rightarrow \neg\)</span> normally visible<br/>
            Since the polygon is not attraction-convex, there exists a
            <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#dead-point">dead point</a> <span>\(q'\)</span>. Let the attractive point be <span>\(p\)</span>.<br/>
            We saw that <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#dead-point">dead points</a> are described by 2 cases :
            (1) <span>\(q' \in e\)</span>, a <span>\( pq'\)</span> perpendicular edge,
            (2) <span>\(q'\)</span> is a <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#convex-vertex">convex vertex</a>
                and <span>\(pq'\)</span> is exterior to the polygon in the neighborhood of <span>\(q'\)</span>.<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
            Consider (1), then the normal from <span>\(q'\)</span> hits <span>\(p\)</span>, and mandatory a part of its
            beam <span>\(B(e)\)</span> hits an interior point of the neighbourhood of <span>\(p\)</span>,
            even the smallest (meaning that it is not normally visible according to the definition).<br/>
                The following figure illustrate the contradiction. The red circle shows that we encountered an interior point in such case.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/proof1.png" alt="PQ' segment touching the neighbour of p"  style="width:100%;max-width:300px;display: block; margin: auto;">
            </figure>

            <p>
            Consider (2), <span>\(p\)</span> must be in <span>\(C(q')\)</span>, otherwise <span>\(q'\)</span>
                would slide until arriving in case (1). since our polygon is simple, <span>\(p\)</span> must be connected
                to the rest of the polygon, implying at least one intersection with our polygon and so, that we hit an interior point
                (meaning that it is not normally visible again).<br/>
                Again, the figure illustrate the contradiction.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/proof2.png" alt="A cone intersecting edges" style="width:100%;max-width:300px;display: block; margin: auto;">
            </figure>

            <p>
                Since the contrapositive has been proven. we are certain that normal-visibility also implies attraction-convexity.
                Therefore, we know that both classes are equals.
            </p>

            <h2>Construction of an algorithm that recognize attraction-convex polygons</h2>
            Let's define intuitively some new definitions with the following figure :

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../../images/pocket2.png" alt="pockets definitions" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;display: block; margin: auto;">
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>
                More precisely, a pocket lid is an edge of the <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#convex-hull">Convex Hull</a> from two non-adjacent vertices.
                The pocket chain is the original path between these two vertices, note that we always consider the pocket chain and the pocket lid in counterclockwise order.
                A pocket polygon is the polygon formed by these two objects.
            </p>

            <p>
                A last definition to show is the definition of terrain polygons. In a very informal way but visual, we can describe
                those polygons as mountain-shaped polygons. More formally, a terrain polygon is a
                <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#monotone-polygon">monotone polygon</a> <span>\(Q\)</span> with an edge <span>\(e\)</span> such that :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> (1) <span>\(Q\)</span> is monotone with respect to the direction of <span>\(e\)</span> </li>
                <li> (2) <span>\(e\)</span> is one of the two <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#monotone-polygon">monotone chains</a> of <span>\(Q\)</span></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../../images/terrain.png" alt="terrain" style="width:100%;max-width:300px;display: block; margin: auto;">
                    <figcaption> A terrain polygon, monotone with respect to <span>\(e\)</span></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>
                Hence, we call a pocket chain a terrain with respect to its lid if the corresponding pocket polygon
                is a terrain with its lid as distinguished edge.<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
                We can observe some interesting properties from latest definitions : Let's observe an attraction convex polygon and a non-attractive one.
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../../images/pocket_property1.png" alt="property1"  style="width:100%;max-width:300px;">
                    <figcaption>(1)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../../images/pocket_property2.png" alt="property2"  style="width:100%;max-width:300px;">
                    <figcaption>(2)</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>
                Firstly, observe that the pocket polygon of the attraction convex polygon is a terrain with respect to its lid
                while it is not the case for the non-attractive one.
                In fact, if a simple polygon <span>\(P\)</span> is normally visible,
                then every pocket chain of <span>\(P\)</span> is a terrain with respect to its pocket lid (for a proof, see the reference).
                Note that it does not reject the existence of non-attraction convex polygons which contains terrains with respect to their lid as we can see on the following polygon : <br/><br/>

                <img src="../../images/terrain_non_attractive.png" alt="terrain non attractive" style="width:100%;max-width:150px;display: block; margin: auto;">

                <br/>
                We can see in (1) that the projection of the beam - from and edge <span>\(bc\)</span>
                of the pocket chain - on the pocket lid, in order to be orthogonal with it, result in a subsegment of it.
                We can also remark that the projection of each point still be counterclockwise sorted.
                (2) shows that this sequence could not be sorted in a non-attractive polygon.<br/>
                This property will be used in the algorithm since we can reject every polygon for which the pocket polygon is not a terrain with respect to its lid.
            </p>

            <h3> Steps of the algorithm</h3>
            <h4>Convex Hull</h4>
            <p>
                We must compute it to check if every pocket polygon are terrains with respect to their lid.
                Since we only study simple polygons, the convex hull can be computed using
                the linear <a href="../Materials/index.html#melkman">Melkman's algorithm</a>.
                which uses a deque to store the vertices of the convex hull. while iteratively adding
                new vertices of the input polygon, interpreted as a simple polyline
                (a <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#chain">polygonal chain</a>) to the deque, if it detects that the new vertex is not part of
                the convex hull, it will remove the vertices using rightmost side and leftmost side of
                the deque to keep the convexity of the hull at each step.
            </p> 

            <h4>Check that every Pocket Polygon is a Terrain with respect to its lid</h4>
            <p>
                We can determine the different pocket polygons of the polygon using the symmetric difference between the convex hull and the polygon.
                Using the Projection of the pocket chain on the pocket lid, we can simply verify that the projection is an ordered sequence of vertex.
                This step can be observed on the Tool page by activating the "Show projection" Button.
                This part of the algorithm give us a necessary condition to verify the normal visibility of the polygon, but it is not sufficient.
                Therefore, it means that whenever we find a pocket polygon which is not a terrain, we can stop the algorithm and simply returns false.
            </p>

            <h4>Clockwise-scan and Counterclockwise-scan</h4>
            <p>
                Let's analyse a bit more a polygon that enter this step.

                <img src="../../images/terrain_non_attractive.png" alt="terrain non attractive" style="width:100%;max-width:150px;display: block; margin: auto;">

                The property that let us reject this polygon is the fact that we have an acute angle in a recess of our polygon (a right turn in our previous image).
                Indeed, the interior angles of attraction-convex polygon is always at most <span>\(3\pi / 2\)</span>
                (implying that the exterior angles is at least <span>\(\pi / 2\)</span>).<br/>


                For the last step of the algorithm, we need to scan our polygon twice, one in clockwise direction and
                the other in the counterclockwise direction.
                The scans will verify namely the presence of acute angles outside the polygon. for more details,
                refer to the <a href="../../html/Code/index.html#ccw"> pseudocode</a>.

            <h1>Inverse Attraction Regions</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The inverse attraction region of a point within a simple polygon is the set of points that
                can attract the given point. The inverse attraction region is a subset of the polygon which is denoted
                as <em>IAR(p)</em>.
                Note that the concept of attraction in the inverse attraction region is the same as the concept of
                attraction in the attraction region. However, if the point <em>p</em> attracts a point <em>q</em>,
                then it does not apply that <em>q</em> attracts <em>p</em>. This implies that the attraction region of
                <em>p</em> and the inverse attraction region of <em>p</em> are asymmetric problems.
            </p>

            <!-- Figure 1: Inverse Attraction Region : Example-->


            <h2>Computation</h2>
            <p>
                As the inverse attraction region is a subset of the polygon, it is important
                to determine the points that can attract the given point. The computation of the inverse attraction
                region is done by constructing the shortest path map
                <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-map"><em>SPM(p)</em></a>
                of the given point <em>p</em> within the polygon <em>P</em>.
                The inverse attraction region is then constructed by considering the
                regions of the shortest path map <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-map">
                <em>SPM(p)</em></a> independently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The article proposes to consider the inverse attraction region
                <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#inverse-attraction-region"><em>IAR(p)</em></a>
                as the union of all <em>Free<sub>i</sub> &cap; R<sub>i</sub></em> for all <em>i</em>.
                We will explain this in more detail in the following sections.
            </p>

            <h3>Region - <em>R<sub>i</sub></em></h3>

            <p>
                Let region <span>\({R_i}\)</span> of the shortest path map <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-map"><em>SPM(p)</em></a> consist of all points <span>\({R_i}\)</span> such that the last segment of the shortest path from <span>\(p\)</span> to <span>\(t\)</span> is <span>\(\overline{v_i t}\)</span>. Vertex <span>\({v_i}\)</span> is called the base of <span>\({R_i}\)</span>.
                Extend the edge of <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-tree"><em>SPT<sub>r</sub>(p)</em></a> ending at <span>\({v_i}\)</span> until the first intersection <span>\({z_i}\)</span> with the boundary of <em>P</em>. Call the segment <span>\({w_i = \overline{v_iz_i}}\)</span> a window, and point <span>\({z_i}\)</span> – the end of the window; window <span>\({w_i}\)</span> is a boundary segment of <span>\({R_i}\)</span>.

            <h3><em>Free<sub>i</sub></em> and Constraining Half-Planes</h3>

            <p>
                To comprehend the inverse attraction region <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#inverse-attraction-region"><em>IAR(p)</em></a> and what is exactly <em>Free<sub>i</sub></em>, it is important to understand the concept of constraining half-planes. The constraining half-planes are used to identify the regions within the polygon <em>P</em> where points cannot attract <em>p</em> due to the presence of vertex <em>v</em>.
            </p>

            <h4>Constraining Half-Planes</h4>
            <p>
                Let <em>uv</em> be an edge of the shortest path tree <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-tree"><em>SPT<sub>r</sub>(p)</em></a>, where <em>u</em> is the parent of <em>v</em>. Extend <em>uv</em> from <em>u</em> until it intersects the boundary of <em>P</em> at <em>w</em>. The segment <em>uw</em> partitions <em>P</em> into two subpolygons. Let <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> be the subpolygon containing <em>p</em>. Any path from <em>p</em> to any point outside <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> must pass through <em>uw</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Case 1: <span>\({u}\)</span> is not in <em>H<sub>1</sub> ∪ H<sub>2</sub>:</em></strong><br>
                Let <span>\({e_1}\)</span> and <span>\({e_2}\)</span> be the edges incident to <em>v</em>. <em>H<sub>1</sub></em> is the half-plane defined by a line orthogonal to <em>e<sub>1</sub></em> passing through <em>v</em> and containing <em>e<sub>1</sub></em>. <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> is the half-plane defined by a line orthogonal to <em>e<sub>2</sub></em> passing through <em>v</em> and containing <em>e<sub>2</sub></em>. If <em>u</em> is not in <em>H<sub>1</sub> ∪ H<sub>2</sub></em>, the supporting line of <em>uv</em> is the only line associated with <em>v</em> that may contribute to the boundary of the inverse attraction region <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#inverse-attraction-region"><em>IAR(p)</em></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Case 2: <span>\({u}\)</span> is in <em>H<sub>1</sub> ∪ H<sub>2</sub>:</em></strong><br>
                If <span>\({u}\)</span> can see part of the edge <span>\({e_2}\)</span>, define the subpolygon <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> and let <em>w</em> be the first intersection of the ray <span>\({\vec{vu}}\)</span> with the boundary of <em>P</em>. The segment <span>\(\overline{uw}\)</span> partitions <em>P</em> into two subpolygons. Let <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> be the subpolygon containing <em>p</em>. Define <em>ρ</em> as the ray originating at <em>v</em> along the extension of edge <span>\({e_2}\)</span> and let <em>z</em> be the first intersection of <span>\({\rho}\)</span> with the boundary of <em>P</em>. <em>P<sub>1</sub></em> is the subpolygon induced by <span>\(\overline{vz}\)</span> containing <em>e<sub>1</sub></em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These constraining half-planes help in identifying the regions within the polygon <em>P</em> where points cannot attract <em>p</em> due to the presence of vertex <em>v</em>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 The set <em>H<sub>i</sub></em> is the set of all constraining half-planes corresponding to the domain subpolygons that contain the point <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> (the base vertex of <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>). <em>Free<sub>i</sub></em> is the intersection of the complements of the half-planes in <em>H<sub>i</sub></em>.
