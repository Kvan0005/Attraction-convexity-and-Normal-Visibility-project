            <h1>Attraction-convexity and normal visibility</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Attraction-convex polygons are those where every point in the polygon attracts every other point.
                The attraction of a point <span>\(q\)</span> to a point <span>\(p\)</span> describes
                a movement system in which <span>\(q\)</span> moves to minimize
                its Euclidean distance with <span>\(p\)</span><br/>

                Normal-visible polygons are those where the normal to each point on the boundary of the polygon
                hits no point of the interior of the polygon.
                A conceptualisation of this second definition is to imagine an ant walking along
                the polygon counterclockwise, with a laser pointing to its right
            </p>

            <div id="antAnimation"></div>

            <p>
                An important part of the article was to prove that these two classes of polygons coincide,
                in order to construct an algorithm to verify if a polygon
                is Attraction-convex, based on Normally-visible polygons.
            </p>

            <h2>Equivalence between the two classes</h2>
            To prove equivalence between the two classes, we must concider the points <span>\(q'\)</span>, that are
            not attract to <span>\(p\)</span> (the <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#dead-point">dead points</a>).
            A dead point can appear in two cases :

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure>
                <img src="../../images/deadpoint1.png" alt="pq' perpendicular dead point" width="300">
                <figcaption>in a <span>\(pq'\)</span> perpendicular dead point. </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                <img src="../../images/deadpoint2.png" alt="convex vertex dead point" width="300">
                <figcaption>or in a Convex vertex dead point.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            either when the point <span>\(q'\)</span> in the interior of an edge such that <span>\(pq'\)</span> is perpendicular to the edge which 
            can result of the point <span>\(q\)</span> sliding along the edge to reach <span>\(p\)</span>. 
            Or when the point <span>\(q'\)</span> is a convex vertex of the polygon.

            <p>
                The proof of the equivalence between the two classes is based on the fact that the existance of a dead points
                in the first class (Attraction-convex polygons) implies the existance of a perpendicular ray that intersects the polygon. <!-- add the thm ?-->
            </p>
            
            <h2>Computation</h2>
            <p>
                As we have seen, the two classes of polygons are equivalent, using the normal visibility property to verify if a polygon is attraction-convex.
                which is (TODO time complexity) to compute. The main property of a normal visible polygon is that the normal to each edge (note that the normal must intersect the edge) of the polygon 
                does not intersect with any other edge of the polygon.
            </p>
            <h3>Convex Hull</h3>
            <p>
                The convex hull of a polygon is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of the polygon. And it can be trivially show that the convex hull of a normal visible polygon.
                thus by calculating the convex hull of the polygon, we can discard all the edges which are in the intersection of the convex hull and the polygon.        
            </p> 
            <h3>Terrain property of edges</h3>

            <h1>Inverse Attraction Regions</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The inverse attraction region of a point within a simple polygon is the set of points that
                can attract the given point. The inverse attraction region is a subset of the polygon which is denoted
                as <em>IAR(p)</em>.
                Note that the concept of attraction in the inverse attraction region is the same as the concept of
                attraction in the attraction region. However, if the point <em>p</em> attracts a point <em>q</em>,
                then it does not apply that <em>q</em> attracts <em>p</em>. This implies that the attraction region of
                <em>p</em> and the inverse attraction region of <em>p</em> are asymmetric problems.
            </p>

            <!-- Figure 1: Inverse Attraction Region : Example-->


            <h2>Computation</h2>
            <p>
                As the inverse attraction region is a subset of the polygon, it is important to determine the points that can attract the given point. The computation of the inverse attraction region is done by constructing the shortest path map <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-map"><em>SPM(p)</em></a> of the given point <em>p</em> within the polygon <em>P</em>. The inverse attraction region is then constructed by considering the regions of the shortest path map <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-map"><em>SPM(p)</em></a> independently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The article proposes to consider the inverse attraction region <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#inverse-attraction-region"><em>IAR(p)</em></a> as the union of all <em>Free<sub>i</sub> &cap; R<sub>i</sub></em> for all <em>i</em>. We will explain this in more detail in the following sections.
            </p>

            <h3>Region - <em>R<sub>i</sub></em></h3>

            <p>
                Let region <span>\({R_i}\)</span> of the shortest path map <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-map"><em>SPM(p)</em></a> consist of all points <span>\({R_i}\)</span> such that the last segment of the shortest path from <span>\(p\)</span> to <span>\(t\)</span> is <span>\(\overline{v_i t}\)</span>. Vertex <span>\({v_i}\)</span> is called the base of <span>\({R_i}\)</span>.
                Extend the edge of <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-tree"><em>SPT<sub>r</sub>(p)</em></a> ending at <span>\({v_i}\)</span> until the first intersection <span>\({z_i}\)</span> with the boundary of <em>P</em>. Call the segment <span>\({w_i = \overline{v_iz_i}}\)</span> a window, and point <span>\({z_i}\)</span> – the end of the window; window <span>\({w_i}\)</span> is a boundary segment of <span>\({R_i}\)</span>.

            <h3><em>Free<sub>i</sub></em> and Constraining Half-Planes</h3>

            <p>
                To comprehend the inverse attraction region <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#inverse-attraction-region"><em>IAR(p)</em></a> and what is exactly <em>Free<sub>i</sub></em>, it is important to understand the concept of constraining half-planes. The constraining half-planes are used to identify the regions within the polygon <em>P</em> where points cannot attract <em>p</em> due to the presence of vertex <em>v</em>.
            </p>

            <h4>Constraining Half-Planes</h4>
            <p>
                Let <em>uv</em> be an edge of the shortest path tree <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#shortest-path-tree"><em>SPT<sub>r</sub>(p)</em></a>, where <em>u</em> is the parent of <em>v</em>. Extend <em>uv</em> from <em>u</em> until it intersects the boundary of <em>P</em> at <em>w</em>. The segment <em>uw</em> partitions <em>P</em> into two subpolygons. Let <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> be the subpolygon containing <em>p</em>. Any path from <em>p</em> to any point outside <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> must pass through <em>uw</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Case 1: <span>\({u}\)</span> is not in <em>H<sub>1</sub> ∪ H<sub>2</sub>:</em></strong><br>
                Let <span>\({e_1}\)</span> and <span>\({e_2}\)</span> be the edges incident to <em>v</em>. <em>H<sub>1</sub></em> is the half-plane defined by a line orthogonal to <em>e<sub>1</sub></em> passing through <em>v</em> and containing <em>e<sub>1</sub></em>. <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> is the half-plane defined by a line orthogonal to <em>e<sub>2</sub></em> passing through <em>v</em> and containing <em>e<sub>2</sub></em>. If <em>u</em> is not in <em>H<sub>1</sub> ∪ H<sub>2</sub></em>, the supporting line of <em>uv</em> is the only line associated with <em>v</em> that may contribute to the boundary of the inverse attraction region <a href="../../html/Glossary/index.html#inverse-attraction-region"><em>IAR(p)</em></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Case 2: <span>\({u}\)</span> is in <em>H<sub>1</sub> ∪ H<sub>2</sub>:</em></strong><br>
                If <span>\({u}\)</span> can see part of the edge <span>\({e_2}\)</span>, define the subpolygon <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> and let <em>w</em> be the first intersection of the ray <span>\({\vec{vu}}\)</span> with the boundary of <em>P</em>. The segment <span>\(\overline{uw}\)</span> partitions <em>P</em> into two subpolygons. Let <em>P<sub>p</sub></em> be the subpolygon containing <em>p</em>. Define <em>ρ</em> as the ray originating at <em>v</em> along the extension of edge <span>\({e_2}\)</span> and let <em>z</em> be the first intersection of <span>\({\rho}\)</span> with the boundary of <em>P</em>. <em>P<sub>1</sub></em> is the subpolygon induced by <span>\(\overline{vz}\)</span> containing <em>e<sub>1</sub></em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These constraining half-planes help in identifying the regions within the polygon <em>P</em> where points cannot attract <em>p</em> due to the presence of vertex <em>v</em>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 The set <em>H<sub>i</sub></em> is the set of all constraining half-planes corresponding to the domain subpolygons that contain the point <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> (the base vertex of <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>). <em>Free<sub>i</sub></em> is the intersection of the complements of the half-planes in <em>H<sub>i</sub></em>.
